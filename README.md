## Advent of Code 2024 ##
If you stumbled onto this repository without knowing what Advent of Code is: it is an annual event where puzzles are posted every day from December 1-25

The first few puzzles are usually pretty simple, and then they ramp up quickly, requiring a good grasp of programming and math knowledge. 

This was the tenth anniversary of the event and the last year of AoC that had a full 25 puzzles, as the creator [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/) decided to shorten the event to 12 puzzles in 2025 
(which I have not attempted yet due to finishing my last year of school)
